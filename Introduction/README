Code adapted from https://thepythonscrapyplaybook.com/freecodecamp-beginner-course/ as an introduction to webscraping.

For bookscraper the following commands are:

- `scrapy crawl bookspider` - Runs the spider crawling through the website
- `scrapy shell` - Puts us into a jupyter style shell
- `scrapy crawl bookspider -O bookdata.csv` - Outputs results to a csv file (After crawling)
